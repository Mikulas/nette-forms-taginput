h2. Requirements

* Nette2.0-alpha - https://nette.org/
* jQuery1.4+ - http://jquery.com/

h2. Usage

Put `tagInput.css` and `tagInput.js` to public directory and link them to the layout. For example, you might use:

bc.    <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen,projection,tv" href="{$basePath}/css/tagInput.css" type="text/css">
        <script type="text/javascript" src="{$basePath}/js/tagInput.js"></script>

then, insert `TagInput.php` anywhere your RobotLoader looks for classes. In your `BasePresenter.php::startup()` register this component with:

bc.    \Nette\Forms\TagInput::register();
    
now, you may simply add this control to any `\Nette\Forms\Form` using

bc.    $form->addTag('tags')
	    ->setDefaultValue($page->tags);
	    
h2. Autocomplete

Simply specify the array of tags as a third argument of addTag() call:

bc.    $form->addTag('tag', NULL, array('tags', 'to', 'suggest'));

You have create an action on the presenter (or mutual ancestor of presenters) where you want to used this control.

bc.    public function actionTagInputSuggestControlname($filter)
	{
		$form = $this->getComponent('componentname');
		$form['controlname']->renderResponse($this, $filter);
	}
	
don't forget to change Controlname in both action name and the array key. Componentname figures only in the getComponent() call.
