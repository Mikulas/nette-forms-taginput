h2. Requirements

* Nette2.0-alpha - https://nette.org/
* jQuery1.4+ - http://jquery.com/

h2. Usage

Put `tagControl.css` and `tagControl.js` to public directory and link them to the layout. For example, you might use:

bc.    <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen,projection,tv" href="{$basePath}/css/tagControl.css" type="text/css">
        <script type="text/javascript" src="{$basePath}/js/tagControl.js"></script>

then, insert `TagInput.php` anywhere your RobotLoader looks for classes. In your `BasePresenter.php::startup()` register this component with:

bc.    \Nette\Forms\TagInput::register();
    
now, you may simply add this control to any `\Nette\Forms\Form` using

bc.    $form->addTag('tags')
	    ->setDefaultValue($page->tags);
